## Testing Instructions

A testing guide has been created in `test-roles.md` that outlines:
- How to test admin functionality
- How to test regular user functionality
- What features to expect for each role

## Technical Implementation Details

### Role Determination
- Uses JWT token from AuthContext to determine user role
- Displays appropriate interface based on role (admin dashboard vs user interface)

### Security
- Backend protection prevents admin users from placing bids even if frontend validation is bypassed
- Frontend validation provides immediate feedback about role restrictions

### Performance
- Efficient database queries with proper joins and limits
- Lazy loading of data based on user role

## Future Improvements

- Add real-time updates for bid activity using WebSockets
- Enhance admin statistics with charts and graphs
- Implement role-based navigation with restricted routes
