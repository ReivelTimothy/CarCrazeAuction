.guest-overlay {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.95) 0%, rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.95) 100%);

}
```

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Authentication Context Integration
- Utilizes existing `useAuth()` hook
- Checks `isAuthenticated` status throughout components
- Maintains security for protected routes
- No changes to backend authentication required

### Route Protection Strategy
```tsx
const GuestAllowedRoute: React.FC<{ element: React.ReactElement }> = ({ element }) => {
  const { loading } = useAuth();
  if (loading) return <div className="loading-container">Loading...</div>;
  return element;
};
```

### Conditional Rendering Pattern
- Home page: `{!isAuthenticated && <GuestWelcome />}`
- Auction cards: `{!isAuthenticated && <GuestOverlay />}`
- Auction details: `{!user && <LoginToBid />}`
- Navigation: `{!isAuthenticated ? <GuestLinks /> : <UserMenu />}`

## ðŸ“± RESPONSIVE DESIGN

### Mobile Optimizations
- Guest overlays always visible on mobile (no hover required)
- Responsive button layouts for guest actions
- Optimized spacing and typography for smaller screens
- Touch-friendly button sizes and click targets

## âœ… TESTING SCENARIOS

### Guest User Experience
1. **Home Page Access** âœ…
   - Guest can visit `/home` without authentication
   - Sees welcome message with login prompts
   - Can browse all auction cards with overlay hints

2. **Auction Details Access** âœ…
   - Guest can view full auction details
   - Cannot access bidding functionality
   - Clear path to login for bidding access

3. **Navigation Experience** âœ…

   - No access to protected routes (profile, admin, etc.)
   - Smooth transitions between guest and authenticated states

4. **Responsive Behavior** âœ…
   - Works correctly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
   - Appropriate touch interactions on mobile devices
